# **Perceptron**

This project implements **Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** models using the **Fashion MNIST Dataset**.  Using the capabilities of both kinds of neural networks, the objective is to categorize photos of clothing items (such as shirts, pants, shoes, etc.) into distinct groups.


## **Overview**

- **Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** are foundational neural network architectures. The SLP is a simple model that uses a single layer of neurons, while the MLP uses multiple layers to learn more complex patterns in the data.

- The **Fashion MNIST Dataset** consists of grayscale images of clothing items, such as shirts, trousers, and shoes, each belonging to one of 10 categories. It is used for training and testing the models.

- **Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP)** is used to demonstrate a simple neural network that works well for linearly separable data. However, it struggles to capture complex patterns.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, with its deeper architecture, is used to capture more intricate patterns in the data. It significantly improves classification accuracy over the SLP.

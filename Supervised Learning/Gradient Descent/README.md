# **Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**

This project uses the **California Housing Dataset** to show how to implement **Gradient Descent** for **Linear Regression**.  Predicting the median home value for California districts using a variety of characteristics, such as median income and house age, is the aim.



## **Overview**

- Utilizes **Gradient Descent** to optimize the supervised learning algorithm (**Linear Regression**). Scikit-learn's **California Housing Dataset** is the dataset.
 It uses properties like `MedInc`, `HouseAge`, and `AveRooms` to predict **house prices** (the goal variable).

- In order to enhance gradient descent convergence, the data is preprocessed by **standardizing** the features. 

- Uses the **cost function** to assess model performance and shows how it decreases with time.


## **Files Included**

- `Gradient_Descent_Linear_Regression.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with code, explanations, graphs, and model evaluation.

## **What’s Covered**

- Data exploration and preprocessing, including handling and standardizing the features.
- **Gradient Descent** algorithm to optimize parameters (weights and bias) for linear regression.
- Cost function analysis to observe model learning progress.
- Model evaluation through the cost function plot over epochs, showing convergence.

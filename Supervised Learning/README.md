# **Supervised Learning**

This project folder contains a series of projects demonstrating various supervised learning algorithms. 

## **What is Supervised Learning ?**

A machine learning technique called supervised learning uses a dataset that contains both the input features and the appropriate output labels to train the algorithm. Acquiring knowledge of a mapping function from inputs to outputs is the aim. The learning process aids in the model's ability to generalize and generate precise predictions on data that hasn't been seen yet.

The data used in supervised learning is usually separated into:
 - **Training Data:** The model was trained using the labeled dataset.
 - **Test Data:** The information utilized to assess the trained model's performance.

 Two primary categories of supervised learning exist:
 **Classification:** Making predictions about distinct labels (such as whether an email is spam or not).
 **Regression:** Forecasting continuous values (for example, forecasting home values based on location and square footage).

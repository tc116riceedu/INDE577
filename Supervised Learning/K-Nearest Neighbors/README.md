# **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier**

This project uses the **Iris dataset** to categorize iris blossoms into several species by implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** method.  Using characteristics like sepal length, sepal breadth, petal length, and petal width, the goal is to identify the species of iris flower.



## **Overview**

- Utilizes **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**, a supervised learning algorithm for classification, where the model predicts the class of a sample based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
  
- The **Iris dataset** is used, which contains data on the physical dimensions of three species of iris flowers.

- Features are **standardized** to ensure fair distance calculations between data points.

- The model's **accuracy** is evaluated by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels on a test set.

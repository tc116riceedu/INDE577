# **Decision Trees**

The **Iris dataset**, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning, is used in this project to illustrate a basic implementation of **Decision Trees** for a classification job.  The objective is to categorize an iris flower's species according to the size of its sepals and petals.



## **Overview**


- Implements a supervised learning algorithm (**Decision Tree Classifier**)
- Dataset: `Iris` dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (also available via Scikit-learn)
- Predicts one of three flower species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**
- Applies tree-based classification by evaluating feature splits using impurity measures (entropy or Gini)
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualizes the trained decision tree structure

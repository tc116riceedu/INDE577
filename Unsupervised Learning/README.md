# **Unsupervised Learning**

This project folder contains projects demonstrating unsupervised learning techniques.  

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

In unsupervised learning, an algorithm is given unlabeled data, and the model's job is to identify patterns or structure in the data.  In contrast to supervised learning, no explicit outputs, or labels, are given.  Exploring the data's underlying structure and grouping or reducing it in some way are the primary objectives.

There are various applications for unsupervised learning, including:
 Grouping data points that are similar to one another is known as clustering (e.g., customer segmentation).
 **Dimensionality Reduction:** Cutting down on features without sacrificing crucial data (e.g., PCA).
 **Anomaly Detection:** Finding anomalous data points that don't fit the pattern.



## The Topics Under this project are:
